##Game

The aplication is a game based on the <a href="http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/">Realm of the Mad God</a> .

The player controls the character (Hero) with the goal  to kill the several enemies you face in order to make progress in
game.

##Interface

The Hero takes a central position on the screen and to move on the map, you have to use a
joystick located in the lower left corner of the screen.


The Hero can take life to its enemies in two ways:

1. "Face-to-face" where the Hero meets an enemy, and while
are in contact, both will lose life acording  with the attacker's power

2. Launching projectiles (in the  game interface represented as
arrows) in the enemy's direction (by touching the screen in the area where it
plans to launch arrow).

###Gems

When an enemy dies it may or may not be generated a gem that can be
caught by our Hero. Those gems can be of three types:

1. Life – gives life points to the Hero.

2. Atack  – the Hero's atack power increses.

3. Coins – the level's progress bar increments. When the user fills the bar with "coins", the portal to the next level opens.

###Objective and Levels

As stated before, a "portal" provides access to the next level. A higher level is characterized by having stronger enemies (removing more life form the hero whenever they attack).
